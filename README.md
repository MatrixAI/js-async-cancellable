# js-async-cancellable

This library provides the ability to cancel asynchronous tasks. Cancelling asynchronous tasks was never standardised in JavaScript. This was due to the myriad complexity of cancellation illustrated by https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancellation:

> system), but that schedules work that will be cancelled (parse the
> publication of an update to the now-cancelled query).

This library attempts to address each concern.

1. Cancel requests, not results - cancellation only affects the immediate promise and all downstream promises, not upstream promises unless explicitly configured via a signal handler
2. Cancellation is heterogenous - cancellation can be customised through a signal handler or an `AbortController`, this allows the user to define how cancellation should propagate through the application
3. Cancellation should be smart - during the `PromiseCancellable.then` binding, both the the fulfilled and rejected handler takes the `signal: AbortSignal`, here it is possible to customise the logic of fulfillment and rejection depending on the situation, therefore cancellation can be as smart as you want it to be
4. Cancellation is a race - this is achieved by using `AbortSignal`, one cannot ask if cancellation is finished, it is purely an event driven system
5. Cancellation is "don't care" - `PromiseCancellation.cancel` is purely advisory, the default behaviour is that the immediate promise is rejected early, however this can be customised, therefore the default intention is that the promise can be rejected with the cancellation reason, and means you don't care about the result anymore, it does not imply anything stronger than this
6. Cancellation requires separation of concerns - by supplying a signal handler or abort controller, it is possible to separate any concern
7. Cancellation recovery is transient - during the `PromiseCancellable.then`, `PromiseCancellable.catch` and `PromiseCancellable.finally`, the signal is passed in, it is possible to change how you cancel depending on what the current situation is.
